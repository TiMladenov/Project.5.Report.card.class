# Project 5: Design Report card Java class
v2.1 of Udacity Project 5 - Report card class

# Description
This project was a chance for me to practice the OOP in Java. I had to create a custom Java class to represent a report card and its properties.

The goal was to design and create the structure of a ReportCard Java Class which would allow a school to store a studentâ€™s grades for a particular year. This project will be just a java class, rather than a full Android app.

The activities related to this project include:
- Designing a custom class.
- Creating that class in Java code.
- Storing information in an array.
- Looping through an array.

# Requirements
The design must include:
- Class design:
  - Any constants contained in the class are never modified and are logical choices for constant values.
  - The submitted project consists of a single .java file, titled ReportCard.java, contained in a .zip file.
  - The class contains appropriate variables to track information which belongs on a report card. The class does not contain variables which should belong, for instance, to a student, a teacher, a school, or a textbook.
  - The class contains at least one constructor which properly instantiates each variable in the class. 
  - Any private variables which might be read off of a report card should have a getter method to access them. 
  - All private variables require a setter method.
  - The class contains a toString() method which returns the contents of the class in a human-readable string. The toString() method should properly use the @Override notation. 
- Functionality:
  - The code compiles without errors
- Code Readability:
  - The code is properly formatted i.e. there are no unnecessary blank lines; there are no unused variables or methods; there is no commented out code.
The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.
  - All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.
